 i took some liberty and user serpapi instead
 in my proto project i used jwt auth and build it according to auth.ts and then i reread the assignment and realize that i for got clerk so i tried to put it here but still teh neon table can still not store clerk userid so a genera fetching conflict occur and i didnt have much time so i do a new stratigy and modified cron job  to fetch 10 articles of all the generas per hour and userr can chose which catagory he wants to see ao it kinda work as intended ,i am sorry for it and if i am selected for next round i will do better thx
